## üìù Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during installation or setup, here are a few tips:

- **Script Execution Policy**: Make sure your PowerShell script execution policy allows the running of local scripts. You may need to run the following command:

   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   ```

- **Permissions**: Ensure you are running PowerShell as Administrator if some parts of the script require elevated permissions.
- **Dependencies**: Check that Git and PowerShell are properly installed and available in your system's PATH.
